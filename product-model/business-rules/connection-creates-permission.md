# Deployment administrator, Owner or the scheduled Product may create Connection

Deployment administrator and Owner manage Connections. Personal model/member projections use the current applicable Policy; forwarding uses the actual resolved Token, fresh Account/Policy constraints where linked, and selected connection. Scheduled discovery requires its configured enabled connection; scheduled WebDAV import follows its configured direction. These continuations do not grant arbitrary public Connection editing.
