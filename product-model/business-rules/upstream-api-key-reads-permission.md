# Deployment administrator, Owner or Gateway client using System token or Gateway client using Account token or the scheduled Product or execution under Connection may read Upstream API key

Deployment administrator and Owner manage upstream API credentials. Forwarding and discovery use the actual selected enabled, secret-bearing credential under the applicable model restrictions and decryption checks. Scheduled synchronization/import writes are continuations of their configured execution; this authority does not expose upstream credentials to downstream customers.
