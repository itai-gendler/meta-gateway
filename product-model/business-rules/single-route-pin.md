# A single-member pin restricts selection while its member remains on the Route; an unset or removed pin falls back to Auto

While the Route's Single member is still one of its members, every other member is ineligible unless the caller pins it explicitly, and cross-channel retry rounds are zero. Members are otherwise scored as under Auto. A pin that is unset, or whose member no longer belongs to the Route, is inert, and the Route selects as under Auto.
