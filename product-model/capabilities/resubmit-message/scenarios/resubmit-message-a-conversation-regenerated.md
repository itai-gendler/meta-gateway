# Resubmit message conversation regenerated

## Trigger

Supply non-empty replacement content and Save and submit.

## Outcome

The selected turn is replaced, following turns are removed, and the regenerated answer is retained.

## Edge cases

- An empty edited message is refused. On upstream failure, the selected edited turn and truncated following history remain the local conversation result with the observed failure; no substituted successful answer is invented.
